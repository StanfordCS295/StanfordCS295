# Course Info

## Lectures

We will publish lecture notes as well as slides for each lecture for anyone who misses or cannot
attend in-person class. While our room does have a recording system, the audio and video quality
doesn't seem to be great. We'll post what we have on Canvas, but we'd still strongly recommend
attending in person if you can---we can't make any guarantees about the quality (or even existence)
of the recording for any given lecture.

## Assignments

There will be 8 weekly assignments for the course as well as a final project. Assignments will
usually be due on Mondays at 11:59 PM, unless indicated otherwise on the assignment handout or the
course schedule. All assignments will be submitted on Gradescope. Each student will be allowed a
total of 3 late days for assignments, which may be spent in units of one day (24 hours) on any
assignment throughout the quarter. There will be no exams in this course.

## Office Hours

Our office hours will be held by instructors at a time to be determined. They will be a mix of
in-person and remote. You can also get help on [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/33103).

## Grading Policy

CS45 is graded on a Satisfactory / No Credit basis. We expect that everyone should be able to earn a
grade of satisfactory. Your course grade will be based on your assignment scores, final project
score, and weekly surveys. You get an S if you earn 25 points in the class:

- Each weekly assignment (1 thru 8) is worth 3 points (Assignment 0 is worth 1 point).
- Each weekly survey is worth 0.5 points.
- The final project is worth 5 points

## Honor Code

As in all Stanford classes, you are expected to follow the Stanford Honor Code. Work submitted for
grading should not be derived from or influenced by the work of others. Do your own thinking, your
own design, your own coding, and your own debugging. Any assistance you receive must remain within
acceptable limits. Truthful citations must be made where required. All submissions are subject to
plagiarism detection tools. Suspected violations are referred to the Community Standards office.

## Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate
the request with the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) located within the Office of
Accessible Education (OAE). SDRC staff will evaluate the request with required documentation,
recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the
current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the SDRC as soon as
possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563
Salvatierra Walk.
