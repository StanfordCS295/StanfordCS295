## Overview

This assignment consists of two different components:

1. **You'll set up a shell environment on your personal computer**
2. **You'll run a shell command to make sure your shell is working**

We expect this assignment to take less than an hour. If you find yourself
unproductively stuck, ask on Ed and/or go to office hours!

## Software Installation

<script>
  import { class_data, fixupLink } from '$lib/classData';
  let assign = class_data.assignments[0];
</script>

Follow the instructions labelled "Setting Up Your Shell Environment" (the first
section) on our [Software Installation page]({fixupLink('/software')}) to set
up your computer with the software we'll be using this quarter.  The
instructions vary by OS; make sure you're following the instructions for
Windows, macOS, or Linux, depending on what you have installed.

If you're unable to follow the instructions (e.g., you have a Chromebook or a
very old computer, or you don't have access to a personal computer), let us
knowâ€”we may be able to help.

## Testing Your Setup

Open the terminal program on your computer, and run the command `uname -a` at
the prompt.  Copy-and-paste the output into Gradescope.

Note that you may not be able to copy from a terminal with `control-c` on
Windows or Linux. Try using `control-shift-c` instead, or right-clicking with
the mouse and selecting "copy" from the menu.

If you're curious, the `uname` command prints information about your system,
like what OS you're running and what CPU your computer has.  The `-a` flag
(short for `--all`) tells `uname` to print all available information.

## Software for Lectures

On the same page as above, we also provide instructions to install the specific
software we'll be using during lectures.  If you want to follow along with us
(which we highly recommend!), you'll want to install those pieces of software
before the respective lecture.

## Submitting Your Assignment

Submit your answer for "Testing Your Setup" on
[Gradescope]({assign.materials.gradescope}).
